# Twitter-Data-Analysis

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze structured problems using Python and Jupyter Notebook, applying concepts of problem-solving, data analysis, and implementation. By working through these exercises, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of how to translate theoretical concepts into practical solutions.

This project allows me to explore a range of problem-solving strategies, test my Python coding skills, and validate results through computation. My objective is to approach each task with an unbiased perspective, ensuring accuracy, clarity, and reproducibility of the outcomes.

I hope this project is both engaging and insightful, as it demonstrates my ability to work independently, analyze given data, and provide meaningful interpretations. The methods and results here reflect a focus on learning and improving technical skills.

DISCLAIMER: This project is purely for educational purposes and is not meant to convey any external views or analyses beyond the scope of the tasks. As a data scientist, my goal is to perform independent analysis objectively and to present insights without any bias.
